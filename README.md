# project_vertigo

## What this is about
This was my very first project to write a website in vanilla html, js & css with a little bit of customized jQuery. 

## Goal
- Create a Landing page which can get colored either to a light or dark Layout.
- Both Version should be entirely independent form each other (different Navbar & different content etc.)

## And this is how the project worked out

#### Landing Page
<img src="./showcase/Hero_showcase.gif" width="500" />

#### White Redirection Page
<img src="./showcase/white_showcase.gif" width="500" />

#### Black Redirection Page
<img src="./showcase/black_showcase.gif" width="500" />

## Suggestions from a later point of view
- Recoloring doesn't need two elements with different hexcodes, but rather just variables which change upon an event
- Git commit structure is not best practice

#### This is where my Journey began...
